| September 24 |  8:55-9:25am  |                                                                                                                                     Beckett and I thought about this multiple ways. One way with binary and then iterative search, but we thought we could do better and provide constant time lookups. Then we realized we need to build a tree with prefixes that continues branching until a final word is reached. |
| September 25 |  2:00-3:00pm  |                                                                                        Beckett and I continued in our conversation, using hash maps to store the text and dictionary. It worked but I tried to improve and ran across a hash set, which doesn't have the value for each key. It's difficult and I cant seem to get it back to the array, so I'm still unsure if the runtime will be distinctly faster. |
| September 26 | 10:25-10:55pm | I kept debugging and testing errors, but my words were printing out all wrong. So, I looked up how the add() function works in HashSet and found that it didn't work very well for this problem because it doesn't ensure the order. Then I searched to find which data structure I could use to replace this, and found that there was a linked version that ensured order. I'm now styling and looking for speedups. |
| September 26 | 10:55-11:25pm |                                                                                                                                                                     I couldn't find much to improve on. I decided to test variability for the tests and they seemed pretty consistent. I'm going to implement my previous iterative versions for more testing to hopefully fully grasp the importance of this speedup. |
| September 26 | 11:25-11:55pm |                                                                                                                                                 I implemented two slow versions of this for comparison. It was so slow that I didn't even wait for the finish for the first one. For the second, I waited and it took over 5 mins. Crazy. This proves just how important these small speedups can be on a large scale. |
| September 30 |  4:40-5:40pm  |                                                              I did a lot here. I converted all pseudocode from class to real code and implemented the classes. I'm still having trouble with indexing and the size of the arrays for each node. I tried to include apostrophes at their own index but the inclusion of other special characters also destroyed the integrity of my structure. Working now to fix that. |
| September 30 |   5:40-6pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                        I fixed it by using 255. Since that is the largest array that can be represented by ints, it takes up a lot of space. But for now, that will have to do (I bet you'll show us a space saver tomorrow in class). |
| October 1    | 11:40-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I implemented the classes for the TST in class. I decided to make a new class for the TST nodes. I thought that it would be better than passing in 3 and 255 everytime I implement a node. |
| October 6    |  10-10:30pm   |                                                                                                                    I implemented the TSTNode class and made isWord() always set isWord to true since that won't ever be reverted. I renamed some of my variables in my Trie and TrieNode file to make them more descriptive. I finished insert() recursively in TST and I'm working on lookup now. Going great so far. |
| October 6    |  10:30-11pm   |                                              I got it to work fully for the most part. I'm going to continue to look for speedups cause I couldn't find a large difference in speeds. The consensus was right, it did seem a little faster on average, but not significantly faster. This could be due to improper implementation or machine differences. Just in case it's the former, I'll work a little more on it. |
