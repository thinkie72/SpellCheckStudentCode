One way with binary and then iterative search, but we thought we could do better and provide constant time lookups. Then we realized we need to build a tree with prefixes that continues branching until a final word is reached. |
| September 25 | 2:00-3:00 | Beckett and I continued in our conversation, using hash maps to store the text and dictionary. It worked but I tried to improve and ran across a hash set, which doesn't have the value for each key. It's difficult and I cant seem to get it back to the array, so I'm still unsure if the runtime will be distinctly faster. |
